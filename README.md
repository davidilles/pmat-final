# WannaDefeat WannaCry?

## Introduction

### Practical Malware Analysis & Triage Course Final Blog Post

As part of my ongoing effort to continously learn something new (and hands-on) related to information security, I have recently completed the excellent course [Practical Malware Analysis & Triage](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-malware-analysis-triage) offered by [TCM Security](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/) . The conclusion of this course is a final challenge that ask students to choose one of the malware samples covered during the course, write a triage report of the sample, write a set of detection rules (using [Yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara)) for the sample,  and publish the findings. This post is my submission to satisfy this course closure requirement.

### The WannaCry Ransomware Cryptoworm

WannaCry is a ransomware cryptoworm, which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting (locking) data and demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. WannaCry surfaced as part of the The WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017.  This attack was estimated to have affected more than 300,000 computers across 150 countries, with total damages ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Security experts believed from preliminary evaluation of the worm that the attack originated from North Korea or agencies working for the country.

### WannaWhy?

I have chosen WannaCry as the subject of my report for two reasons. First, it is a real-live malware that (to me at least) is more interesting to look at compared to lab-grown education specimen. Second, the WannaCry attack was famiously halted by [Marcus Hutchins](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/marcus-hutchins-on-halting-the-wannacry-ransomware-attack-still-to-this-day-it-feels-like-it-was-all-a-weird-dream)  by identifying a "killswitch" in the malware, which story always fascinated me as some sort of "cyber-superhero" deed. 

### The Purpose of The Post

The purpose of this post, apart from satisfying the course requirement :) is to demistify how simple techniques (all covered in the course) can be used to identify WannaCry's killswitch and confirm that the killswitch is indeed real to showcase that these can simple techniques can be very effective even when applied to real, extremely destructive malware.

This post is **not** intended to provide a full analysis of the malware specimen, most notably its propagation mechanism is completely ignored by the analysis.

## Taking a First Look

Once specimen `Ransomware.wannacry.exe` is received, even before it is first "detonated" (ran) some basic information can be found out.

It's SHA-256 hash is `24D004A104D4D54034DBCFFC2A4B19A11F39008A575AA614EA04703480B1022C`:
```
PS C:\Users\analyst\Desktop> Get-FileHash .\Ransomware.wannacry.exe

Algorithm       Hash                                                                   Path
---------       ----                                                                   ----
SHA256          24D004A104D4D54034DBCFFC2A4B19A11F39008A575AA614EA04703480B1022C       C:\Users\analyst\Desktop\Ransomware.wannacry.exe
```

Which could be used to investigate if it was seen in the wild before (for example by searching on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search) ) which step is excluded from this post as it is a well-known sample at this point.

The sample is a 32-bit Windows executable:
```
C:\Users\analyst\Desktop
λ file Ransomware.wannacry.exe
Ransomware.wannacry.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
```

The sample also contains some interesting strings embedded in it. When the strings are extracted using the `FLOSS` tool:
```
C:\Users\analyst\Desktop
λ FLOSS.exe Ransomware.wannacry.exe > floss_results.txt
INFO: floss: extracting static strings...
--snip--
```

A strange URL can be found potentially indicating a C2 server or other remote host related to the attack's infrastructure:
```
http://www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com
```

Cryptography-related strings can be found indicating potential ransomware capabilities:
```
Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider
CryptGenKey
CryptDecrypt
CryptEncrypt
CryptDestroyKey
CryptImportKey
CryptAcquireContextA
```

And (among other things we'll not mention here) a string can be seen that is indicative of command execution capabilities:
```sh
cmd.exe /c "%s"
```

Dissecint the executable using [PEView](http://wjradburn.com/software/) the potentiality of cryptographic capabilites is further supported by inspecting the `Import Address Table`:

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230216224845.png)  

PEView also provides evidences that suggests that the specimen does not use packing techniques, but the screenshots are excluded for simplicity.

After this initial look, there is a strong suspicion that the specimen:
- Is a cryptographic ransomware
- Potentially makes connections to an external host for unknown purposes
- Potentially has command execution capabilities

It is time to detonate it and see what it does!

## Detonating the Sample

### A Note on the Detonations 

When handling dangerous malware (such as WannaCry) safety is paramount. For this analysis two Virtual Machines (VMs) were leveraged:
- A Windows-based host with the [FLARE VM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) toolkit installed, and
- A Linux-based host with the [REMnux](https://remnux.org/) toolkit.
None of the VMs had internet connectivity or connectivity to other VMs or the Host system.
The analysis was primarily carried out on the Windows host, with the Linux host used as an internet simulator (using the package `inetsim`). 

When it is noted that internet was simulated, `inetsim` was configured to provide the services: `DNS`, `HTTP`, `SMTP`, `HTTPS`, `POP3`, `FTPS`, `SMTPS`, `POP3S`, `FTP`, and to respond to any query.
(e.g.: an arbitrary `HTTP` or `DNS` request to something like `http://doesnotexist.really` would return results successfully) 

The detonations described below were done by running the specimen as `Administrator`. The malware did produce differences in behaviour when ran as a regular user, but these findings were excluded to focus on the killswitch detection aspects of the analysis.

### Detonation without network connectivity

The malware when detonated without network connectivity almost immidiately produces significant indicators of compromise. For example.

A popup informing the user that theire files are encrypted:

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217222326.png)  

Or the presence of the executable `@WanaDecryptor@.exe` on the desktop and the extension `.WNCRY` added to the end of the user's files:

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217222450.png)  

This confirms the suspicion that the specimen is ransomware, but can be surprising if our assumption of the strange URL was of a command and control server.

### Detonation with Internet Simulation

The malware when detonated with internet simulation can be observed to connect the URL identified above (`http://www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com`):

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217224137.png)  

And (at first glance) does not exhibit any other significant activity.

**This is an important realization. It suggests that the URL acts as a killswitch to the malware, however the lack of appearance of immidiate significant Indicators of Compromise does not mean that the malware is completely harmless in case the URL can be reached. It might only instruct the malware to be more stealthy, and further analysis is required to ensure that the suspected killswitch is indeed a killswitch.**

## Investigating the Suspected Killswitch

### Static Analysis

To confirm the killswitch as a genuine one, the specimen can be loaded into a disassembler (`Cutter` was used for this analysis as it is the tool covered on the course) and the logic related to the URL can be observed. 

The results are encouraging, as the URL appears immediately on the malware's `main` method before any other function call would take place:

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217224923.png)  

Also, no other action is taken by an application except system calls related to visiting the url (`InternetOpanA`, `InternetOpenURlA`), which calls are followed by a test on the success of the connection:

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217224940.png)  

Please note, that on the branch that corresponds to the test succeeding, no other function of the malware is called (except two `call esi` calls), and execution is returned from the `main` method, effectively stopping the application.

In regards to the `call esi` instructions, it can be seen that these relate to the `InternetCloseHandle` system call to terminate the TCP connection.

This analysis confirms the hypothesis that the killswitch is genuine.

### Dynamic Analysis

This behviour can also be confirmed dynamically, by loading the specimen into a debugger (`x32dbg` used as it is the course's preferred debugger) and following its execution.

Placing a breakpoint on the `InternetOpenUrlA` system call:

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217225735.png)

The connection being made can be observed both in the debugger:

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217225851.png)

And in Wireshark:

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217225950.png)

Followed by the jump corresponding to the test (as a result of a successful connection):

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217230144.png)

The system calls `InternetCloseHandle`

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217230221.png)

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217230259.png)

Followed by the execution returning from `main` to the entry point:

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217230338.png)

Leading to the `exit` of the program:

![](/_images/Pasted%20image%2020230217230423.png)

## Detection Rules

Based on the uniqueness of the killswitch domain, a simple [Yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) rule to detect this malware can be as created as:

```yar
rule IsWannaCryMalware {
	strings:
		$mz = "MZ"
		$wannacry_domain = "iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea"
	condition:
		($mz at 0 and uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x4550) and $wannacry_domain
}
```

The above simple rule could effectively identify the specimen on the lab VM:
```
C:\Users\analyst\Desktop
λ yara64 WannaDetect.yara -r C:\ 2>nul
IsWannaCryMalware C:\\Users\analyst\Desktop\Ransomware.wannacry.exe
```

## Conclusion

The above analysis have demonstrated how simple techniques taught on the Practical Malware Analysis & Triage course could be leveraged to triage a real-life malware sample, identify the killswitch embedded within it, and confirm the killswitch to be genuine.
